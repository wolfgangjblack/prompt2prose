            "Jack's pulse quickened as he reached for his communication device, his fingers dancing over the familiar buttons. With unwavering trust in Dr. Selene Thorne, he transmitted an urgent message, his voice steady despite the gravity of the situation. \"Dr. Thorne, it's Jack. I've made a discovery of immense significance here on the lunar surface. The artifact... it's unlike anything we've encountered before. I need your expertise, now more than ever.\" Each word carried the weight of the unknown, a plea for guidance in the face of profound uncertainty. As he awaited her response, the vast expanse of the lunar landscape seemed to hold its breath, echoing the silent anticipation that enveloped him.\n",
