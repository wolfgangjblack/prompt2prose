        "\n",
        "For this I'll further evolve the architecture from part I. Because I have an agentic workflow I can add additional agents and checks to the code to the pipeline. This allows me flexibility to help change style, affect prose, get additional reference material (not yet supported), etc. I could even use the internet, forums, or RAG to help guide prose generation. \n",
        "\n",
        "For this part I'll add 2 main agents.\n",
        "- MetadataAgent: This agent takes in metadata provided by the user and merges it with the context generated by ContextAgent at each beat. This can help provide general character motivations, scene details, etc. Like LengthAgent - this is not an LLM based agent and therefor does not increase token cost. For this problem I expected a specific format for the user provided metadata, however that can be handled with a little client training and ETL pipeline. \n",
        "- StoryGenreAgent: This agent is an aggressive editor dedicated to rewriting prose in a specific style or genre. This is currently my weakest solution - It would likely be better split into multiple agents with unique specific prompts as opposed to just formatting the genre/style into the Agent Prompt. However, I wanted to experiment with general prompts. One can see this does add airs of genre to the prose. However style is specifically difficult. \n",
        "\n",
        "Aside: for me, I think of style as poetic, novel, newspaper, talk like a pirate. Happy to talk details in the conversation. \n",
        "\n",
        "As for how I'd capture this data if it wasn't provided by the user. We can scan context from previous writings, chapters, forums/sites, styles and ask contextAgent to further evolve its context to include things like setting details (Where is this setting, what happens there, who lives there, etc) and character details (who is this person, who are they related too, what motivates them). However, I did that partially for part I - so expanding that wouldn't be much work. Here I wanted to show off how incorporating the writers specific vision for a setting/character would enhance the story. \n",
        "\n",
        "Other honorable mentions: \n",
        "- RAG: use for data/context gathering. Could submit tomes of information on worlds, characters, race relations (Tolkien like - dwarves and elves), and have context generate details based on expected tropes and source material. \n",
        "- Model finetuning: We can finetune open source models using SST or we can finetune chatgpt using their API - but these finetune models can specialize in writing specific styles or translating prose from one standard into another. In my experience this is significantly stronger - but does require more testing and data. \n",
        "- For data capture for finetuning we could use NLP techniques like semantic search, similarity, and classification to get data for finetuning on style, genre, or event specific models\n",
        "\n",
        "For cost, we're already reducing token generation - though finetuning local models/open source and doing distilation training can drive costs down in the long run. \n",
        "\n",
        "For metrics/generational goodness this is a BIG question in the field. Some things we could explore are topic adherence (similar to my context/StoryAgents) paired with keyword analysis and semantic similarity. For instance, we can search for a Town, a Character, or an Event and make sure descriptions/events/etc are all similar around that keyword. Though this would have to be researched for long term viability. For creative quality, you could use perplexity scores, coherence metrics, and readability measures to assess the prose's fluency and engagement level.\n",
        "\n",
        "I also like to include human-in-the-loop metrics. We could pass prose off to editors, lay people, writers, etc to review. Some passages would be human written, some would be AI. We'd use scores of readability, consistency, flow, etc from the audience to assess goodness. Once we have this dataset, we could train NLP classifiers. \n",
